Swampscott Idea Exchange.

There is a list of ideas which may need some community software development volunteers:

1. Seniors 
  - helping seniors learn how to work a computer
  - feeling isolated and wanting more accessible transportation.
  - shuttles connecting residents to Humphrey Street shops and the Vinnin Square
  - senior transportation into Boston connecting to volunteer drivers.
  
2. Beautification, culture, and recreation;
  - Beautification volunteer app to share events and ideas
  
3. Children
  - recreational center for kids  
  - finding ways to get kids more active while spending less time on their digital screens. (This may be a community volunteering app)
  - organized hikes and obstacle courses
  
4. Town services, finances, and taxes; 
  - Town services app
  - improvement for the town website
  
5. Waterfront areas.
  - town’s “Welcome” sign (maybe some IoT app)
  - community picnic area booking app
  - pop-up events at the beaches
  - organized beach clean-ups (community volunteering app)
  - ways to attract leisure boats
  - volleyball nets on the beaches during summertime
  
6. The town’s community arts center


It looks like there are few use cases for the "community volunteering app"
- share events, town info, etc
- share volunteering oportunities
- subsrtibe to perform volunteer work during a particular event.
- promote paid services if you have a good volunteering record?
